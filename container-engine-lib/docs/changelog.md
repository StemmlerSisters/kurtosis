# TBD
### Features
* Expose information of an `APIContainer` object

# 0.10.1
### Features
* Added API container CRUD stubs to `KurtosisBackend`

# 0.10.0
### Features
* Created a generic `ContainerStatus` object in the `KurtosisBackend` API for representing the state of containers
* Added enclave CRUD commands to `KurtosisBackend`

### Breaking Changes
* The `Engine` object's status will now be a `ContainerStatus`, rather than `EngineStatus`
    * Users should migrate to the new version

# 0.9.1
### Fixes
* Fixed container `removing` state erroneously counting as running

# 0.9.0
### Changes
* Switched from fairly-specific engine methods on `KurtosisBackend` to generic CRUD methods (`CreateEngine`, `GetEngines`, etc.)
* Pull the `ForEngineServer` method into this repo, rather than relying on obj-attrs-schema-lib, since the name/label determination really makes sense next to the DockerKurtosisBackend
* Commented out the `KubernetesKurtosisBackend` until we can revisit it in the future
* The `DockerManager` now logs to the system `logrus` instance like everything else

### Removals
* Removed the `KurtosisXXXDrivers` classes, as we're going to use `KurtosisBackend` as the external-facing API instead

### Breaking Changes
* Removed the `KurtosisXXXDrivers` classes
    * Users should use the `KurtosisBackend` struct instead
* Changed the API of `KurtosisBackend` to have generic CRUD methods for engines
    * Users should adapt their previous uses of specific methods (like `Clean`) to instead use these generic CRUD APIs
* Switched the `ContainerStatus` enum to be an `int` with dmarkham/enumer autogenerated code
    * Users should switch to using the new methods autogenerated by the enumer code
* Removed the `logger` parameter to the `NewDockerManager` function, as it's no longer needed
    * Users should remove the parameter
* The `HostMachineDomainInsideContainer` and `HostGatewayName` parameters are no longer public
    * There is no replacement; users who were depending on this should use the `needsAccessToHostMachine` parameter when starting a container
* The `DockerManager` package has been moved
    * Users should replace `github.com/kurtosis-tech/container-engine-lib/lib/docker_manager` -> `github.com/kurtosis-tech/container-engine-lib/lib/backends/docker/docker_manager`


# 0.8.8
### Features
* Added the `KurtosisDockerDriver` struct with methods that don't do anything 

# 0.8.7
### Features
* Added KubernetesManager, KurtosisBackendCore Interface with implementations for both kubernetes and docker and the KurtosisBackend layer
* Upgraded `object-attributes-schema-lib` to 0.7.2

# 0.8.6
### Fixes
* Run `go mod tidy`, to get rid of unnecessary `palantir/stacktrace` dependency

# 0.8.5
### Fixes
* `stacktrace.Propagate` now panics when it receives a `nil` input

# 0.8.4
### Features
* Container logs are propagated throughout the returning error when container start fails

# 0.8.3
### Fixes
* Fixed issue where `GetContainersByLabel` would return `0.0.0.0` addresses rather than `127.0.0.1`
* Replaced redundant `getContainerIdsByName` with `getContainersByFilterArgs`

# 0.8.2
### Fixes
* Host port bindings will be returned as `127.0.0.1` rather than `0.0.0.0`, because Windows machines don't automatically correct `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1`

# 0.8.1
### Features
* Added `GetVolumesByLabels` and `GetNetworksByLabels` functions

### Fixes
* For comments on the public functions, added the function name as the first line of the comment to make GoLand stop complaining

# 0.8.0
### Features
* Added the ability to add labels to networks & volumes

### Breaking Changes
* `CreateNetwork` now also takes in a list of labels to give the network
* `CreateVolume` now also takes in a list of labels to give the volume

# 0.7.0
### Features
* Added the ability to specify fixed host machine port bindings when starting a container is now available via the key of the map in `CreateAndStartContainerArgsBuilder.WithUsedPorts` function

### Breaking Changes
* The `CreateAndStartContainerArgsBuilder.WithUsedPorts`'s parameter now has a value of `PortPublishSpec`, which defines how the port should be published
* `CreateAndStartContainerArgsBuilder.ShouldPublishAllPorts` parameter has been removed
    * Users should migrate to `CreateAndStartContainerArgsBuilder.WithUsedPorts` instead

# 0.6.1
### Features
* Added `RemoveVolume` and `RemoveContainer` functions
* Added a `GetVolumesByName` function

### Changes
* Clarified that the `all` argument to `GetContainersByLabels` is for whether stopped containers should be shown

# 0.6.0
### Features
* Add `Network` type to store Docker Network information as ID, name, ip and mask

### Breaking Changes
* Replaced `GetNetworkIdsByName` method with `GetNetworksByName` because it returns a `Network` list which offers more information
  * Users should replace `GetNetworkIdsByName` calls with `GetNetworksByName` and get the network ID and other network information from the `Network` list returned by this new method

# 0.5.0
### Breaking Changes
* Renamed `Status` type to `ContainerStatus` which is used in the `Container` struct
  * Users should replace `Status` type with `ContainerStatus` in all places where it being used

### Features
* Add `HostPortBindings` field into `Container` type to store the container public ports 

# 0.4.4
### Changes
* Removes Docker container name prefix `/` before using it to set a Container's name

# 0.4.3
### Features
* Add `Container` type to store container's information as ID, names, labels and status
* Add `GetContainersByLabels` method to get a container list by labels

### Changes
* Removes `GetContainerIdsByLabels` it'll be replaced by `GetContainersByLabels`which returns container ids as well along with other container info

### Fixes
* Fixed a bug where `CreateAndStartContainerArgsBuilder.Build` method wasn't setting container labels

# 0.4.2
### Fixes
* Fixed a bug where the defer function in `CreateAndStartContainer` would try to kill an empty container ID

# 0.4.1
### Features
* Add container's labels configuration when a container is started
* Add a new method `DockerManager.GetContainerIdsByLabels` to get a container ids list by container's labels

# 0.4.0
### Features
* `CreateAndStartContainerArgsBuilder`'s boolean-setting functions now accept a boolean

### Breaking Changes
* `CreateAndStartContainerArgsBuilder`'s boolean-setting functions now accept a boolean (used to be no-arg)

# 0.3.0
### Features
* `CreateAndStartContainer` now accepts args as built by a builder (hallelujah!)

### Breaking Changes
* `CreateAndStartContainer` now accepts a `CreateAndStartContainerArgs` object, rather than the gigantic list of parameters

# 0.2.10
### Fixes
* Fixed some logging that was being incorrectly being done through `logrus`, rather than `DockerManager.log`

# 0.2.9
### Fixes
* Added retry logic when trying to get host port bindings for a container, to account for https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/42860

# 0.2.8
### Features
* Made `PullImage` a public function on `DockerManager`

# 0.2.7
### Features
* Added extra trace logging to Docker manager

# 0.2.6
### Changes
* Added extra debug logging to hunt down an issue where the `defer` to remove a container that doesn't start properly would try to remove a container with an empty container ID (which would return a "not found" from the Docker engine)

# 0.2.5
### Fixes
* Fixed a bug where not specifying an image tag (which should default to `latest`) wouldn't actually pull the image if it didn't exist locally

# 0.2.4
### Fixes
* Add extra error-checking to handle a very weird case we just saw where container creation succeeds but no container ID is allocated

# 0.2.3
### Features
* Verify that, when starting a container with `shouldPublishAllPorts` == `true`, each used port gets exactly one host machine port binding

### Fixes
* Fixed ports not getting bound when running a container with an `EXPOSE` directive in the image Dockerfile
* Fixed broken CI

# 0.2.2
### Fixes
* Fixed bug in markdown-link-check property

# 0.2.1
### Features
* Set up CircleCI checks

# 0.2.0
### Breaking Changes
* Added an `alias` field to `CreateAndStartContainer`

# 0.1.0
