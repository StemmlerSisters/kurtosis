# TBD
### Changes
* The `DockerKurtosisBackend` will now track the free IPs of networks
* `KurtosisBackend` now has `UserServiceRegistration` CRUD methods
* Service containers in Docker no longer get tagged with a service ID (this is now on the service registration object)

### Breaking Changes

    * Users should update their imports/packages accordingly
* Removed the `ServiceID` field of the `Service` object
    * Users should query for the `UserServiceRegistration` associated with the service to find service ID
* `KurtosisBackend.CreateUserService` now takes in a service registration GUID, rather than a static IP
    * Users should make sure to call `CreateUserServiceRegistration` and pass in the returned GUID to the user service
* `GetLocalDockerKurtosisBackend` now takes in an optional argument for providing the enclave ID, if running inside an enclave
    * API containers should pass in the information; all other consumers of the `DockerKurtosisBackend` should pass in `nil`
* Removed the GUID parameter from `KurtosisBackend.CreateService`
    * Users no longer need to provide this parameter; it's autogenerated
* Switched the `CreateFilesArtifactExpansionVolume` from using `ServiceGUID` -> `UserServiceRegistrationGUID`
    * Users should now provide the registration GUID
